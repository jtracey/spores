This is a repo for some data and scripts I've made to track the rate of vulnerabilities from new contributors introduced to Firefox Oxidation projects, to compare before and after it was replaced with Rust. Here is everything it has right now, though it will grow:
 - *get_bugs.sh:* A sample script for downloading some CSV files from Mozilla's Bugzilla instance that might be relevant. I don't actually use this script, and instead use custom searches to just manually keep an eye on things, but it's here to give an idea of the kind of thing you would want to search for with this data. The problem with the script is that it's basically just using search queries for relevant terms and tags, which aren't as accurate as we might like (e.g., I've yet to find a good, automated way to establish whether bugs are in the MP4 part of libstagefright or somewhere else).
 - *bugzilla_hg.py* A script that takes as input a Bugzilla bug number, and outputs a file that has, on each line, the number of commits a user who contributed to that bug (i.e. were at least partially to blame for it) had at the time of their contributing commit. Must be run from the top of the Firefox source directory. See the comments at the top of the file for more info. I also have a version of this script that works with github issues, designed for use with Servo, that I'll add at some point.
